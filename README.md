### ðŸ”­ Future Prospects
In near future we are gonna add group chats, photo sharing options.
#### Long term prospects
- To ease the conversation and amidst someones' busy schedule where they might forget to text their close fruends a happy birthday or a happy new year or thansgiving, we will set a reminder in the app so that when the clock strikes 12 in tne morning, the message will be sent with a permission from the user.
- To list the users based on the amount of conversation they have with each other we will be adding a feature that will sort the friends in a particular order that will ease their convo & take their UX to the next level.
